/// Foundation-free string scanning at L1 / L2 MUST default to the UTF-8
/// byte view, not `unicodeScalars`. Citation: `[IMPL-089]`.
///
/// #24 defect 7 scoping: "Foundation-free" is the rule's own stated
/// scope, and it is mechanically checkable the same way
/// `Lint.Rule.Foundation.Import` checks it — by whether the file
/// imports a Foundation-family module. A file that imports Foundation
/// (or `FoundationEssentials`/`FoundationNetworking`/`FoundationXML`)
/// is not attempting Foundation-free scanning in the first place, so
/// `.unicodeScalars` there is not the harm this rule exists to catch;
/// such files are exempt. Full receiver-type resolution (distinguishing
/// a `String`'s `.unicodeScalars` from an unrelated type's
/// same-named member) is NOT implemented — a syntax-only rule has no
/// type checker, and that limitation is unchanged by this scoping
/// pass. A false positive on a non-`String` receiver is suppressible
/// with this engine's own `// swift-linter:disable:next string utf8 scanning`
/// directive (not a SwiftLint directive — the wrong tool for this
/// engine).
///
/// ## Spec-mandated scalar algorithms — ruled disposition
///
/// Ruled 2026-08-01 (swift-institute/.github#90 comment 5150641576 item 1,
/// sourced from the batch-1 backlog, comment 5150595934): a specification
/// whose algorithm is DEFINED over Unicode scalars / code points rather
/// than bytes — the confirmed instance is RFC 3492 Punycode, whose
/// encoding is specified in code points — is **accept-as-warning**, NOT a
/// predicate exemption.
///
/// Rationale: no stable syntactic property distinguishes a spec-mandated
/// scalar algorithm from an ordinary `.unicodeScalars` misuse. "This file
/// implements RFC 3492" is semantic knowledge, not syntax; the Foundation-
/// import gate above works precisely because an `import` IS syntax, and
/// there is no equivalent token here. Widening the predicate on a
/// filename, a module name, or a comment would be a path/name exemption in
/// disguise, and the engine already ships the correct instrument: a
/// per-site `// swift-linter:disable:next string utf8 scanning` with a
/// `// REASON:` continuation naming the specification section. The
/// justification is then reviewable at the site that needs it, which a
/// blanket predicate exemption would not be.
