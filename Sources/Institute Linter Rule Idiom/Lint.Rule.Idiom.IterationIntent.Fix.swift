/// The canonical fix for `[IMPL-033]`: climb the range loop to
/// `(<range>).forEach { <name> in … }`.
///
/// The fix is narrower than the finding, deliberately and permanently. A
/// `for` body is a statement context and a `forEach` body is a closure, and
/// the two differ in every construct that transfers control out of the
/// loop: `break` and `continue` have no closure spelling at all, `return`
/// returns from the closure rather than the enclosing function — silently,
/// and with the opposite meaning — and `try`, `throw`, and `await` cross a
/// `rethrows`, non-`async` boundary that erases or rejects them.
///
/// A loop containing any of those is therefore NOT autofixable, and this
/// leaves it exactly as it found it. It remains a finding, for a person to
/// resolve by restructuring rather than by translation. That is the whole
/// discipline of a rewriter-backed rule: the rewriter takes the subset it
/// can transform with certainty, and hands back the rest unchanged rather
/// than guessing. A fix that translated `return` into a `forEach` body
/// would compile and silently change what the program does, which is the
/// one outcome worse than not fixing it.
///
/// The scan is subtree-wide and does not stop at nested closures or nested
/// function declarations, where those constructs would be harmless. That
/// over-refuses, and it should: the cost of refusing a fixable loop is that
/// a person fixes it, and the cost of accepting an unfixable one is a
/// behaviour change nobody reviewed.
///
/// ## Accepted false refusals
///
/// The predicate is deliberately coarser than the truth, in four places
/// where the true test is not available to syntax. Each costs fixes on
/// loops that would have translated correctly. All four are accepted:
///
/// - **Any loop lexically inside a closure.** Whether a closure is a result
///   builder body is decided by an attribute on the parameter it is passed
///   to, which lives in another file. So `xs.map { … }`, `Task { … }`,
///   `withLock { … }`, and every other plainly-a-function-value closure
///   keeps its loops unfixed, alongside the `VStack { … }` bodies this is
///   actually aimed at. The earlier carve-out for closures with a parameter
///   signature was unsound and is gone: a builder parameter may be a
///   function type taking arguments.
/// - **Any loop under a declaration returning `some …`, or carrying an
///   attribute whose name ends in `Builder`.** Both are name-shaped
///   evidence, and a `@ConfigurationBuilder` that is not a result builder
///   refuses for nothing.
/// - **Any loop with a comment in a position the rewrite rebuilds.** See
///   ``idiomIterationIntentDropsComments(_:)``: a documented loop header is
///   left alone rather than have its comment deleted.
/// - **Any loop whose body mentions a name that matches a `borrowing`/
///   `consuming` parameter of the enclosing declaration, even one shadowed
///   by a same-named local.** See
///   ``idiomIterationIntentReferencesOwnershipAnnotatedBinding(_:)``: the
///   match is by name, not by resolving the binding, because the parameter
///   set considered is exactly the enclosing signature and nothing beyond
///   it is guessed at.
///
/// A refused-but-safe loop stays a finding, which is a person reading one
/// line. A fixed-but-broken loop is a silent behaviour change in a commit
/// nobody looked at. The asymmetry is the whole argument.
