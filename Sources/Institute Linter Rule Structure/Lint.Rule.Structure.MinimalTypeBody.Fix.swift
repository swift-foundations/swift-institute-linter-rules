/// The canonical fix for `[API-IMPL-008]`: move the members the rule flags
/// out of the primary type body into a same-file `extension`.
///
/// ## Hard preconditions (each an outright refusal, no partial application)
///
/// - **`class` and `actor` declarations are never touched.** A method in a
///   class body is dynamically dispatched and overridable; the same method
///   in an extension is not. Where nothing overrides it the rewrite
///   silently changes dispatch semantics; where something does, it breaks
///   the build. Only `visit(_:StructDeclSyntax)` and
///   `visit(_:EnumDeclSyntax)` are overridden below — a `class` or `actor`
///   body is never rewritten, at any nesting depth, and its members are
///   never partially moved.
/// - **The generated extension is always emitted at file scope**, because
///   that is the only place Swift allows an `extension` declaration at all
///   (verified: `extension` nested inside another type or extension body is
///   `error: declaration is only valid at file scope`). Same-file placement
///   is therefore not a style choice this fix could relax — it is what
///   keeps `private` members of the moved-from type mutually visible to the
///   moved-out members (Swift extends `private` to same-file extensions of
///   the declaring type), and it is preserved by construction here, not by
///   a check that could drift from the engine's own same-file fix contract.
///
/// ## Scope this fix accepts, and why narrower is safe
///
/// Only a struct/enum reachable from `SourceFileSyntax` by climbing
/// EXCLUSIVELY `ExtensionDeclSyntax` ancestors is fixed —
/// ``structureMinimalTypeBodyIsFixEligible(_:)``. A struct/enum nested
/// inside another nominal type (including inside a `class`/`actor` body) is
/// left as a standing, unfixed finding. This is deliberately narrower than
/// the detector, which fires at any nesting depth:
///
/// - The fix's only tool for referencing a nested type from file scope is
///   `Outer.Inner`, built by reusing the enclosing `extension`'s own
///   `extendedType` syntax (never a re-parsed string) via
///   ``structureMinimalTypeBodyEnclosingExtendedType(_:)``. That composes
///   safely through the institute's own `extension Parent { struct X }`
///   idiom (at most one `ExtensionDeclSyntax` ancestor, since an extension
///   itself is never nested — see the file-scope rule above), but does not
///   generalize soundly through an arbitrary chain of nominal-type
///   ancestors without risking a name collision or losing a generic
///   parameter list this syntax-only rewriter cannot see resolved.
/// - A struct/enum declared inside `#if` is ALSO excluded, even though it
///   IS reachable through extension-only ancestors otherwise. Unlike
///   `structureIsFileSignificant` (`Lint.Rule.Structure.Shared.swift`),
///   `#if` is NOT transparent here: the generated extension is emitted
///   unconditionally, so fixing a declaration that exists only under a
///   platform condition would reference a type absent on every other
///   platform the output must still compile on.
/// - A struct/enum carrying `@available` — on the declaration itself, OR
///   inherited from an enclosing `extension` on the climb this fix already
///   performs — is ALSO excluded. The generated extension carries no
///   attribute list, so `extension Widget { … }` for a `@available(macOS
///   15, *) struct Widget` fails to compile: `'Widget' is only available
///   in macOS 15 or newer`. The enclosing-extension case is not
///   incidental — it is the repository's own house idiom (`extension
///   Lint.Rule { @available(...) ... struct \`X Tests\` { ... } }`), and a
///   predicate that inspected only the declaration's own attributes would
///   miss it entirely. Copying the attribute list into the generated
///   extension is not attempted: it is not safe in general (an
///   `@available` platform/version pair does not always transfer
///   correctly onto a same-file `extension` of the same type — see the
///   package's `class`/`actor` refusal above for the same asymmetry
///   argument), so this fix refuses rather than propagates.
///
/// A refused-but-safe declaration stays a finding — a person reading one
/// line. A fixed-but-broken file is a silent behaviour change nobody
/// reviewed. Per the package's established rewriter discipline, the
/// asymmetry is the whole argument.
///
/// ## Members this fix moves, and the one category it declines
///
/// ``structureMinimalTypeBodyPartition(_:)`` moves exactly what
/// `StructureMinimalTypeBodyVisitor.checkMembers(_:)` flags: static/class
/// properties, computed properties, functions, subscripts, non-sentinel
/// typealiases, nested types without the extension-pattern attribute, and
/// nested protocols. It declines one thing the detector still flags: a
/// member wrapped in `#if`. `Lint.Syntax.IfConfig.members(_:)` splices `#if`
/// clauses so the DETECTOR still sees what is inside them, but moving only
/// the inner declaration out from under its `#if` guard would silently drop
/// the conditional-compilation boundary. A mechanical fix must not do that,
/// so an `#if`-guarded member is left in the primary body — unmoved,
/// unconditionally correct, and (if flagged) still a standing finding for a
/// person to resolve.
