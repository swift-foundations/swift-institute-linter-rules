/// The canonical fix for `[PLAT-ARCH-022]`: qualify the bare stdlib
/// protocol reference.
///
/// This rule is the archetype of a mechanizable one. Its finding names a
/// single token, its fix is one qualification of that token, and the
/// qualified form is the only correct one — there is no judgment left for a
/// reader to apply. Everything the rewriter must be careful about is
/// already encoded in the detector: the same four syntactic positions, the
/// same stdlib-shadow exemption, the same composition-descending walk. The
/// rewriter mirrors the visitor rather than reimplementing its predicate,
/// so the two cannot drift into disagreeing about what is a finding.
///
/// Trivia is preserved by construction: the base and dot are synthesized
/// with none of their own, and the original identifier's leading trivia
/// moves to the base while its trailing trivia stays on the name. A fix
/// that reflowed comments or indentation would make every review of a fix
/// commit a diff review rather than a spot check.
///
/// One thing the rewriter must know that the detector does not: whether the
/// bare name it is about to qualify still means the stdlib protocol. The
/// finding is about a name that READS ambiguously and is worth making
/// wherever the name appears. The fix ASSERTS which protocol was meant, and
/// it is wrong whenever the file declares its own `Error`, `Sequence`, or
/// `Collection`: `struct Boom: Error` becomes `Boom: Swift.Error`, compiles
/// clean, and `x is Error` silently flips from true to false. A `typealias
/// Error = Swift.Error & Sendable` loses its `Sendable` bound the same way.
/// Nothing downstream catches either — the rewrite type-checks.
///
/// So the fix refuses a name the file itself declares, and the finding
/// stands for a person to resolve. The scan is file-local, which is the
/// widest scope a linter reading one file has; a shadowing declaration in a
/// sibling file or re-exported from a dependency stays outside what this can
/// see, and is sized separately before any fleet application.
