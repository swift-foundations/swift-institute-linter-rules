// MARK: - Recorded scope decisions
//
// The contexts below were enumerated against the SwiftPM target model
// (`regular`, `executable`, `test`, `system`, `binary`, `plugin`, `macro`,
// plus the `Snippets/` directory convention) on 2026-07-25, after this rule
// had over-reported in three non-main-target contexts discovered one incident
// at a time. They are recorded here so a future instance is a known change
// rather than a rediscovery.
//
// - `executable`: **exempt as policy, deliberately NOT implemented.** An
//   executable ships as a binary and imposes Foundation on no library
//   consumer, so it does not commit the harm this rule prevents. It cannot be
//   implemented here: executable targets live in `Sources/<Name>/` exactly
//   like library targets, so no path predicate can distinguish them. Doing so
//   needs manifest awareness in the engine — a different change to a
//   different component. 88 institute manifests declare executables; how many
//   of those targets actually import Foundation is unmeasured, and that
//   sizing should precede any engine work.
//
// - `plugin`, `macro`, `snippet`, `system`, `binary`: **zero instances across
//   the institute fleet** (2,224 manifests, 2026-07-25). Deliberately not
//   exempted — a both-direction fixture for a context with no real instance
//   means inventing the shape being exempted. Detection approach when a first
//   instance appears: `plugin` and `snippet` are path-distinguishable by the
//   SwiftPM `Plugins/` and `Snippets/` directory conventions and belong in
//   `foundationImportNonMainTargetRoots`; `macro` is NOT path-distinguishable
//   and shares the executable problem above; `system` and `binary` carry no
//   Swift sources, so nothing reaches this rule.
//
// ⚠️ The general limit, worth reading before adding a fourth gate: **this
// class is not closed under path.** Three contexts happened to be
// path-distinguishable and were fixed; `executable` and `macro` are not, and
// no further enumeration changes that.
